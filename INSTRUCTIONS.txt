This application will extract in a CSV file all clips from a giving channel, this can be imported into google sheets or excel.

To run this application you need to do from your command line in the path of where you unzip this application:

> twitch-clips -client_id xxxx -secret yyyy -channel zzzz -output clips.csv -date_from="2023-11-01" -date_to="2023-11-15" -sort_by=DATE

You can omit the parameter output it will be clips.csv by default.

Sort By is optional and can be either DATE or VIEWS, DATE by default.

Additionally you can omit as well the date from/to parameters to return clips for all dates.

> twitch-clips -client_id xxxx -secret yyyy -channel zzzz

The optional date from/to arguments could not bypass the way the twitch API handle these arguments.

If you specify a date from, but not a date to, it will return the clips from that date to two weeks after.

If you specify a date to, but not a date from, it will return all the clips without considering any date.

If you need to generate a client id and a secret you could do that in the twitch developer console:

https://dev.twitch.tv/console

Then click on: Register Your Application

Give it a Name, however some words are forbidden such "Clip" or "Twitch", use something like: 

My <User> App

In OAuth Redirect URL, this will be not be used however needs to be set, just type:

https://localhost

In Category you could use: Application Integration

In Client Type choose, since this just run in your computer : Confidential

This will generate a Client Id.

To generate a secret click on: New secret

Write these down so you can use then with this program.

Alternatively, if you don't want to type/copy those every time you can set these environment variables:

TWITCH_CLIENT_ID and TWITCH_SECRET with the corresponding values.

You can set those in Windows following these steps:

    Windows Key + Q 
    Type: View Advanced System Settings 
    Click: Environment Variables
    Click, for each variable: New
    Set as Variable name TWITCH_CLIENT_ID or TWITCH_SECRET and it corresponding value.

For Linux and & MacOS you can add the environment variable to your shell profile such .bashrc
    export TWITCH_CLIENT_ID="your application client id"
    export TWITCH_SECRET="your application secret"

When the variables are set you can run the application with:

> twitch-clips -channel zzzz -output clips.csv -date_from="2023-11-01" -date_to="2023-11-15" -sort_by=DATE

As before you can omit the parameters output, sort by and dates:

> twitch-clips -channel zzzz
